      p The only officially accepted way to add apps to an iOS terminal is to use Apple's <em>App Store</em>

      ul
        li Apple has total control over which apps are accepted on the store
          ul

            li Apple guidelines are strict and sometimes difficult to match
            li guarantees a minimal quality of apps
        li developper license (99$ / year) necessary to submit an app
        li free developper account sufficient to develop and install apps on personal devices
        li developpers receive 70% of the price of the sold app

      h1 About this Lecture
      p iOS development is a vast topic
      ul
        li many elements cannot be addressed in this lecture (including important ones)
        li even with more time, one never fully knows all about iOS programming
          ul
            li hundreds of existing classes
            li thousands of methods and attributes
            li best way to learn is to look for examples, ask questions and read the documentation
        li the API, SDK and language evolve quickly
          ul
            li examples and discussions on the Internet are already outdated
            li this lecture is also already outdated
        li most elements are interconnected
          ul
            li no natural order to present things
            li examples require to use some elements before explaining them
